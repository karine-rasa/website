                    During a nighttime escapade, two students decide to squat in what appears to be an empty house. But their ordinary evening quickly takes a sinister turn when something catches their attention. Something they were never meant to see. Something that will mark the beginning of a strange and terrifying adventure that will change them forever.</p>
                <p class="box-text-content">
                    We’re all chasing something, aren’t we? Something we believe — or rather, hope — has the power to give us that ultimate thrill. Or simply the will to live.It was a Tuesday night, just before midnight. Wrapped in a thick black hoodie, Kennedy crept out of her father’s office as quietly as possible after having unplugged the surveillance camera server. Every few steps, she froze, listening to make sure the snoring from her parents’ bedroom — just a few paces away — hadn’t stopped. On tiptoe, she headed for the kitchen, where her sneakers and her ever-faithful gray backpack were waiting for her on the tiled floor. She grabbed them and slowly opened the door that led outside. Once the opening was wide enough, she slipped out like a cat and closed it behind her, still in total silence.
                    As she bent down to put on her shoes, something cold and wet brushed against her leg, making her jump. She turned around to find a big dog staring at her. Paco, the German shepherd, wagged his tail excitedly at the sight of his mistress and started bouncing around, eager to play. Kennedy patted his head and planted a big kiss between his ears before heading toward the backyard of the vast property.
                    At the very back, behind a tangle of brambles, was an old wooden stile. She dragged it to the other side of the garden and propped it against the wall. After giving Paco — who hadn’t left her side since — a tap on the head, she climbed up. Once at the top, she lifted the ladder again, now placing it on the street side, and climbed down.
                    Once on the ground, she carefully hid the escape tool behind the bushes.
                    Suddenly, the yellow glow of a car’s headlights lit her up for a second before disappearing, plunging the driveway back into darkness.

                    The sky was darkening and drops of water began to fall slowly. Thunder could be heard approaching. 
                    Soon, the rain would pour over the empty field. 
                    Sure, the car wrecks scattered there made good shelters, but the problem was the parents. 
                    If they came home soaked, they’d be scolded. Yet none of the three children seemed willing to move. 
                    They were crouched on the ground behind a tireless grey Golf, staring at the corpse of a bird they had placed earlier on the other side of the old beater. 
                    It had been Zeke’s idea. Ever since a stray dog had settled on their playground—their precious little rusty field, far from the city and the parents—the animal had enjoyed terrorizing them. 
                    The mutt particularly had it in for Rico. For some unknown reason, it was always him the dog attacked. When he got bitten on the arm, Zeke, like a good older brother, decided it was enough. 
                    That very day, after bringing his younger brother back home, he ran out of the house and didn’t return until several hours later, holding a dead pigeon, which he presented to Rico and Hazel.
                    “Tomorrow, it’s that bastard I’m going to kill.”

There, memories and long-buried feelings that strained their relationship in the past resurface, for an ultimate confrontation.

                    What day was it again? She couldn’t remember. She only recalled being heartbroken. 
                    That and the heat. It was a very hot, very sunny day… Alone in the stable, with the sounds of the reception in the distance, she sat on a bale of hay, surrounded by the quiet presence of the horses.
                    She was sweating under her long black dress and that stupid mantilla. 
                    Loïc dissuaded her from wearing it, but she didn’t listen. She rarely listened to her brother. 
                    And she wanted to cover her face anyway. Mostly because she didn’t want to face the guests. Wearing a veil created the ideal distance between her and her surroundings. She was there, but not really. Besides, she didn’t want people to see her cry. Or worse, not cry. They might think of her as some heartless brat who couldn’t even shed a tear for her poor daddy. But there were so many people. How can one be openly vulnerable in front of so many people? No. There weren’t any tears that day. Even though she was missing her father desperately. After all, they were best friends, he was her daddy, she was his little princess.

                    1. EXT. ROAD - EARLY MORNING

                        Few minutes before sunrise. The colorful bus slaloms on the
                        road surrounded by green nature. Calm and peaceful.

                    2. INT./EXT. BUS - CONTINUOUS

                        Inside the bus, people are squeezed to each other, struggling
                        to find a position to sleep in. OCÉANE (24) is in the back.
                        She is awake, her eyes are tired. She is pressed between the
                        window and some OLD LADY who fell asleep on her shoulder. She
                        holds her back pack tightly on her legs.

                        The old lady snores a little. Océane sighs and looks outside.
                        The sun rises slowly. The landscape is beautiful but she is
                        sad.

                    3. EXT. BUS STATION - LATER

                        Océane sits on the bench with her backpack and luggage. She
                        looks around, clearly lost.
                        The previous passengers are picked up by their relatives,
                        including the old lady who fell asleep on her shoulder
                        earlier.

                        After a few times, she is left alone in the parking lot. She
                        finally stands up and walks to a cab.

                    4. INT./EXT. CAB - DAY

                        The cab goes through the town, its streets, a school, a
                        supermarket, a park. There are only a few people outside.
                        Océane looks around with an empty expression.
                        Soon, the cab leaves the town to take a road leading to the
                        countryside.

                    5. EXT. ROAD - DAY
                        The cab leaves her at the edges of a dirt road adjoining the
                        main road. She takes a look around before following the dirt
                        road.

                    1. EXT. MARKAT - MORNING
                    The people of Markat are setting up the market. The streets are crowded. Carts, oxen, stalls, merchants carrying their goods, stirring up dust into the air.
                    Men are setting up their stalls in the village square.
                    Women come out of their homes with baskets under their arms.
                    Children play tag in the streets and bump into a LITTLE BOY, who falls, along with his toys: a wooden snake and a small human figurine. The boy, about 8 years old, grimaces and gets up. He brushes off his clothes. He picks up his toys.
                    He keeps playing with them, making the snake and the figure fight.

                    LITTLE BOY
                    (playing with the figure)
                    Take that, you monster! I'm the strongest! Pow! Pow!
                    The human defeats the snake, which falls to the ground.
                    LITTLE BOY
                    Yeah!!!
                    The boy jumps around. He smiles and prepares to pick up the snake.
                    The snake on the ground trembles — the earth itself is shaking.
                    The boy watches, one eyebrow raised, surprised. A sudden breeze blows from behind, rustling his clothes and hair. Without picking up his toy, he turns around.
                    He sees houses and, in the distance, the great dark forest.
                    He squints.
                    Far off, the treetops are shaking violently, as if someone is shoving the trees aside to make their way through. It looks like it’s coming straight toward the village — fast.
                    The boy drops the human figure. The figurine is caught by the wind. It lands under a cart and gets crushed.
                    We see the crushed figurine in the foreground, and the boy, from behind, staring at the forest.
                    The thing is getting closer.

                    Title: Germinal
                    
                    Author: Émile Zola

                    I understand why this book is considered a classic of French literature. I’m glad I waited before reading it because I was really able to appreciate it—both for its straightforward plot and for the other layers of meaning it offers.

                    It wasn’t hard to read (not like Proust), but it wasn’t as simple as Maupassant either. Still, it was very enjoyable. The story itself is tragic, even though I often mistakenly believed things would get better. I dove into the story as if I too were living in that mining village where the workers were exploited. I felt their anger, their longing for a better and fairer world. I understood that things couldn’t change so easily; the Voreux alone couldn’t have changed the fate of all of France. Still, something in me hoped it could, just as Étienne thought it might at first.

                    But at the same time, in the midst of the industrial crisis, I also understood the bourgeoisie. I felt sorry for poor Mr. Deneulin, who poured everything into his forge only to lose it all. He wasn’t a bad man—he was an honest man who took a chance, but luck wasn’t on his side. In the end, everyone was a victim of the crisis. And it was heartbreaking to see how things unraveled for the miners.

                    I found the characters well written—both endearing and despicable, evoking pity and contempt at once. I liked how Zola portrayed their evolution during the strike: their friendship as well as their cruelty; the effects of hunger and misery on the human mind; the consequences of power, flesh, intellectual and material poverty passed down from generation to generation. How the worst of each character came out when misfortune struck. I liked the tragic realism of it all. I think it was a fairly accurate depiction of that era—in a matter of lifestyle, mentality, and daily life. I wasn’t there, but I believe it was like that because Zola paints such a vivid picture.

                    Personally, my favorite character remains Le Maheu. I prefer characters who are reasonable and level-headed. Souvarine too—even though his communist ideology didn’t appeal to me, I liked the character himself, with his strange personality and unwavering conviction.

                    The further the story went, the less I cared for Étienne, and even less for La Maheude. Still, I felt pity for these poor people though. They were all reckless and oblivious, but they didn’t know any better. They were uneducated folks who had never known any other life. And in the end, even though everyone suffered, they were the ones who took the hardest hits.

                    The way the story developed, the constant frustration, the suspense (I could have guessed that the Company wouldn’t budge, especially after the destruction caused by the strikers—but I didn’t want that ending. I wanted justice)

                    I truly appreciated this reading—for its storytelling and its historical aspect. It reminds us that the world doesn’t necessarily change in a day. That even if we’re not all born equal in society, people aren’t simply good or bad because of their social status. That it’s more complicated than just “overthrowing the rich and giving to the poor.” That a revolting crowd is an uncontrollable force that ends up destroying itself, and that the human heart is its own worst enemy.

                    From Étienne and his thirst for power, to the miners and their impulsiveness born from ignorance, to Catherine and her inability to escape her own misery, to the bourgeois and their idleness. The ending was very sad. Over two months of striking, for nothing. Returning, heads down, to a job that paid nothing. Étienne leaves a different man from the one he was when he arrived, but the situation hasn’t changed. People died.

                    And yet, there was a glimmer of hope. Zola spoke of a slowly rising anger, suggesting that this was only the beginning—and that one day, it would work, truly and permanently. Even though they seemed to have failed—because they had, undeniably—and the losses were immense, one might think it only triggered a bigger, more powerful machine. One of justice and fair labor, one of hatred toward the old society, one of the movement against patriarchy, one of revolution.

                    I really liked this book, even though it disgusted and saddened me. The storytelling, the characters, the sequence of events, the time period... It wasn’t an easy plot to take in—it was horror after horror, disappointment after disappointment. But the writing was very pleasant, and you couldn’t help but grow attached to these uneducated people who were only asking for bread. There’s a lot to take away from it—about society and about human nature.

                    Title: The long saturday night

                    Author: Charles Williams

                    Overall impression

                    Vivement dimanche was a short but enjoyable read. It moves along quickly, but it’s easy to keep up with the pace. For me, this book was an emotional rollercoaster. Maybe it was because it was short and I could finish it in under a day, or because the story was so well-structured that I just couldn’t put it down. I’ve always loved detective novels, suspenseful stories, and crime fiction. This one was no exception.

                    Pacing

                    It was very easy to get lost in the book. I was immediately hooked by the setting, the characters, and the plot. And despite its brevity, the investigation was detailed—the character had to dig deep instead of just scratching the surface, which I really appreciated. It made for better immersion.
                    
                    Characters / Relationships

                    The main character in himself wasn’t particularly special. Duke is a fairly “standard” kind of character—he’s smart and witty, and as a businessman, he takes matters into his own hands, albeit sometimes clumsily. Still, I liked the moments of anger and despair he showed; they felt realistic and well depicted. Plus, each of these outbursts only made things worse for him, digging him deeper into trouble—which was quite frustrating for the reader, in a good way.

                    I liked the character of Barbara too, even though she was a bit of a cliché: the intelligent, sexy woman who is humble and discreet. The characters were introduced in a way that led to plenty of red herrings from the very beginning.

                    If I had one criticism, it would be that I wish there had been a more striking clue about the culprit when he first appeared—something that would have seemed meaningless at the time but gained weight once the evidence came to light. I suppose there was something: the time argument. But I didn’t find it strong enough in the moment. Then again, perhaps the reason we couldn’t see it coming is that it reflects Georges’ character—the culprit. Everything in the details, nothing out of place. If that was intentional, then it was well done.


                    All the same, I found the ending slightly anticlimactic. I understand why they went about it that way, and I agree that they couldn’t have done it differently when faced with someone like Georges. But I didn’t get the twist I had hoped for.

                    However, waiting for Denman’s call about the envelope was still quite thrilling. Duke constantly watching Georges to see if he’d react or not... the suspense was definitely there. Now that I think about it, maybe that moment was the climax, rather than when they finally caught Georges in the phone booth. And if that’s the case, then it wasn’t so bad—but it still could have been stronger. It was thrilling, but still a bit flat.

                    I also want to briefly mention the progression of Duke and Barbara’s relationship. I liked how his growing admiration for her was written. It wasn’t rushed. You could tell he was attracted to her, but this was a serious matter—Duke was being accused of murdering his wife. It felt organic. You could see that he was starting to like her, but no romance was introduced, which I really appreciated because, after all, this was a murder investigation. In the end, without any unnecessary explanation, Duke simply says they’re going to get married soon—and I thought that was just perfect. There was no cheesy love story, but we understood and accepted this conclusion as a logical next step, because their relationship—though void of romance—foreshadowed that ending.

                    Writing style

                    The writing was good. Very immersive, though my reading experience was slightly hindered at times. I read the book in its French translation, and some of the phrases were confusing if you only considered the French. I didn’t struggle too much because I also speak English and could easily guess the original meaning. But it’s something that could quickly become unpleasant for a reader relying solely on the French version.

                    Of course, I’m aware that this isn’t the author’s fault, but the translator’s. If I had to guess the author’s style from the translation (which is tricky), I’d still say it felt fluid, a bit witty sometimes.

                    Overall

                    It was a good read. Despite the occasionally clumsy French translation, it was enjoyable. A complex story that delves deep, characters whose personalities remain consistent and well written despite a few stereotypes (which, honestly, didn’t bother me that much), and an ending that, while a bit underwhelming, still made sense given the antagonist’s personality.

                    Despite the minor inconsistencies, the awkward translation, and the scattered clichés, I had a good time reading this book.
